Input -> Array of intergers (num)
Output -> return length of longest consecutive sequence (integer)

Must run in O(n) time

use set so that all the num is unique
num_set = set(nums);

loop through set to check for n-1, if n-1 exist, counter +1

if n - 1 does not exist, streak = 1

loop n + 1 to check if they exist in loop,
if exist streak +=1 else break
