### Time Complexity
- O(n)

### Pattern
- For Loop

#### Notes
- Classic two pointer question, one left pointer that starts from index 0 and right from last index
- if sum of the two numbers nums[left] and nums[right] is equal to target return the index
- read the problem statement carefully to check if it is index 0 or index 1
